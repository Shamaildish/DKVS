You can simply run the program using script 'run' in dir 'src/cmake-build-debug' with 3 arguments:
1. number of servers you would like to deploy (currently adding one more server after clients being deployed).
2. number of clients you wold like to deploy
2. capacity of servers.

You can run the program using 'DKVS' in 'src/cmake-build-debug' directory.
- To deploy load balancer use command "./DKVS 0 <consisting-hash-size>"
- To deploy server use command "./DKVS 1 <port> <hash-size>"
- To deploy the client use command "./DKVS 2"

make sure you are replacing <> with apropriate argument.

Have fun!
