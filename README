You can simply run the program using script 'run' in Debug directory with 2 arguments:
1. number of servers you would like to deploy.
2. capacity of servers.

You can run the program using 'DKVS' in Debug directory.
- To deploy load balancer use command "./DKVS 0 <consisting-hash-size>"
- To deploy server use command "./DKVS 1 <port> <hash-size>"
- To deploy the client use command "./DKVS 2"

make sure you are replacing <> with apropriate argument.

Have fun!
